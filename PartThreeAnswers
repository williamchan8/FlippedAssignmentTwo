1. The program would still work but the data displayed on the line would look incorrect. With the bigger buffer array, the ending elements would always be zero 
which would skew the data since there will be data points that return a max of zero. In order to fix this problem, you could double the timeData which would make it
the FFTData. 

2. It would be better to pause the audioManager instead of deallocating because we are constantly going back and forth from the TableViewController to 
the ViewController. By deallocating audioManager, it would increase overhead by needing to reinstantiate a new audioManager everytime someone pressed the back button
and went back into that View Controller.
